## Before you contribute

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier.

There are multiple ways to contribute to this product
* Adding a new connector.[Refer here for instuctions](/add_connector.md)
* Improving the readability of the code. *The aim for this project is to make sure even non-rust programmers understand the payment journey. Hence, some of the code in core functions (e.g. payments_core) is written to be more readable rather than being idiomatic.*
* Bug fixes and feature enhancements

## Getting familiar with the project

The architecture is somewhat unique; it was originally inspired by XML pull parsers, but ended up going in somewhat of its own direction. To get familiar with it,

    start by reading the README page, which gives some details on the product and its goals

The source code can be approached by skimming the API documentation first (we have an open_api.yaml file which could be viewed as documentation using any open API editor or plugins), then explore the code.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, requires detailed review before getting merged. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
